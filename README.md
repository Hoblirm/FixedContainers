# FixedContainers
C++ containers such as Arrays, Strings, Vectors, Lists, and Queues that remain a fixed size during runtime.  Using these containers can optimize code and prevent runtime allocations.  The interfaces of these classes are intended to match the std library to make it easy to insert into existing code.
